    <p>Packaging systems are complicated. And opionated. However, this blog
post is not to tell what is the best packaging system available. They
all excel and suck in different ways.</p>
<p>This series of blog posts is trying the shed some light into the
Debian packaging. This is the first part where we will dive into the
basics of the Debian packages. The series is not looking into
particular ways of installing the packages (tools like <code>apt-get</code> or
<code>aptitude</code>).</p>
<p>This series also looks these things from the Debian perspective. While
derivatives, like Ubuntu, differ a bit, most of this guide still
holds.</p>
<h2>A Debian Package</h2>
<p>Debian package itself is a fairly simple thing. The package has a
filename, which is in format <code>&lt;name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.deb</code>.
Name is pretty self-explaining, version and architecture parts are a
bit more interesting.</p>
<h3>Filename</h3>
<p>Let's pick a sample package. If you have an access to a Debian box,
you can find a pile of packages in the apt-tool's cache under
<code>/var/cache/apt/archives</code>. Anyway, here is our brave example-package:
<code>xfonts-100dpi_1%3a1.0.3_all.deb</code>.</p>
<p>So, as stated before, the name is a simple thing. In this case the
name is "xfonts-100dpi". Version is <code>1%3a1.0.3</code>. The <code>%3a</code> is an
escaped colon, so the version actually is <code>1:1.0.3</code>.</p>
<p>The version has a lot in it, so let's split it a bit. <code>1</code>, before the
colon, is an "epoch". It is kind of a safety valve for upstream
mishaps. If the upstream version, <code>1.0.3</code> in this case, gets transformed
to something that no longer lexicographically orders correctly, the
epoch can be used to overwrite that. An example could be a package
first versioned with date (<code>20141022</code>) and then later changed to more
traditional semantic versioning (<code>1.0</code>). In this case the <code>1.0</code> would
be deemed an earlier release. Epoch allows Debian package maintainer
to keep the sorting of the versions correct while still using the new
upstream version. Of course this is a handy way to fix the mishaps of
the maintainer.</p>
<p>After the upstream version follows Debian packaging version. This is
the iteration of the Debian packaging for <em>this</em> upstream version. It
is customary to reset it back to 1 if a new upstream version is
released. Not all packages have the Debian packaging version. In that
case they are packages maintained in the Debian, not based on anything
upstream outside the Debian project.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the versioning or sorting of versions, the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version">Debian Policy Manual</a>
contains a pretty good explanation about that.</p>
<h3>File format</h3>
<p>Like the file name, the format is not too complicated either. Debian
packages are standard <code>ar</code> archives. The archive includes two <code>tar</code>
archives, which can be compressed. One of these archives contains the
software, the other one contains the metadata of the package. Third
file in the package is a version number of the <code>deb</code> file. It contains
2.0 for current versions. Using our example package, this is what it
(and any other package) contains:</p>
<pre><code>$ ar -tf xfonts-100dpi_1%3a1.0.3_all.deb
debian-binary
control.tar.gz
data.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<h3>Package Metadata</h3>
<p>If we unpack the package and look into the control file, we see a
bunch of files:</p>
<pre><code>$ tar tf control.tar.gz
./
./postinst
./postrm
./conffiles
./control
./md5sums
</code></pre>
<p>We'll dive into these files a bit deeper in the upcoming parts, but a
short primer is in place. <code>control</code> contains the metadata of the
software, like dependencies, maintainer and version among others.</p>
<p>The <code>md5sums</code> contains, as name suggests, the MD5 checksums of the
files in the package. The <code>conffiles</code> contains listing of all the
configuration files this package has.</p>
<p>More interesting parts are the <code>postinst</code> and <code>postrm</code> files. There
are two additional files not present in our test package, <code>prerm</code> and
<code>preinst</code>. As names suggest, these files are ran before the removal
(prerm) and installation (preinst) as well as after the removal
(postrm) and installation (postrm). The files are just ordinary shell
scripts called with certain set of parameters, depending on the
situation. The
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/MaintainerScripts">Debian wiki</a> has informal
flowcharts of what happens in the installation.</p>
<p>All these files of the existing, installed, packages are also
available under <code>/var/lib/dpkg/info</code>. This is especially useful if an
installation ends up in a some sort of limbo due to for example a
buggy postinst file. In that case the file can just be modified in
place under the <code>info</code> folder and the installation continued.</p>
<h2>Creating packages</h2>
<p>So there you go: a quick primer to the Debian packages. In the next
part we will look into creating Debian packages.</p>
