    <p>A fellow pythonaut asked a question on #python.fi IRC channel: would
it be possible to "rewind" during <code>git rebase --interactive</code>? He
wanted to go back and edit a few commits during his massive rebase
operation and then continue the operation from the same point.</p>
<h2>Initial situation</h2>
<p>I assume you know in general what
<a href="http://help.github.com/rebase/">rebase</a> does (too bad the kernel.org
has no longer the man pages, or anything to that matter, served). If
not, I suggest to check that previous link or to run <code>git help
rebase</code> on your commandline.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume you have following repository structure:</p>
<pre>
      D - E - F (*another-branch)
     /
A - B - C (master)
</pre>

<p>You want to rebase <code>another-branch</code> on top of the <code>master</code> and edit
every one of those commits on the way. Naturally, you use <code>git rebase
--interactive master</code> while checked in <code>another-branch</code>. Now you edit
commits D and E, transforming them to D' and E' respectively, and you
have a following repository structure (in middle of the rebase):</p>
<pre>
      D - E - F (another-branch)
     /
A - B - C - D' - E' - F' (HEAD)
        ^
      master
</pre>

<p>Now, while editing F, you notice that you forgot to add something in
D while rebasing it. Traditionally, the two options here are to abort
rebase, rebase again and correct mistakes or to skip remaining commits
and manually cherry-pick them back after rebase. But let's assume
you've modified a load of commits and need to modify yet another load
of commits in this rebase, so you don't want to abort. The solution?
Let's just mimic how the rebase works!</p>
<h2>Magic part: Rewinding in rebase!</h2>
<p>First: Let's create us a point to return to by creating a temporary
branch in the F commit: <code>git branch continue</code>. So you have following
structure now:</p>
<pre>
      D - E - F (another-branch)
     /
A - B - C - D' - E' - F' (HEAD/continue)
        ^
      master
</pre>

<p>Next we'll check out the commit we want to modify: <code>git checkout D'</code>
and hack it for the parts needed. After hacking, we'll
replay the rebase: Technically rebase with edits is just cherry
picking of commits, so well do that. First let's see what to
cherry-pick by running <code>git log continue</code>, which returns something
like this:</p>
<pre>
486106d edit edit (F)
ea857b6 Moar edits (E')
</pre>

<p>While repository looks like this:
<pre>
      D - E - F (another-branch)
     /
A - B - C - D'' - E' - F' (continue)
        ^   ^
   master   HEAD
</pre></p>
<p>Now we just replay the rebase by issuing <code>git cherry-pick ea857b6</code> and
<code>git-cherry-pick 486106d</code>. Now we're back at the point where we
rewinded to the D' and can continue rebase normally! Just do the edits
on the F you need to do and say <code>git rebase --continue</code> and you'll get
on with your rebase, and finally the tree looks like this:</p>
<pre>
A - B - C - D'' - E' - F (HEAD/another-branch)
        ^
   master
</pre>

<h2>Word of caution</h2>
<p>This is more of a proof of concept trick and has worked on one real
life scenario (and I've tested it on simulated environment), but I
recommend you to back up your working directory / <code>.git</code> before trying
this at home.</p>
<p>Or (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/akhern">Akheron</a>) true warrior just
digs through reflog and does not waste extra disk space for puny backups!</p>
